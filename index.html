                                Matt's Talk:
                                Matt Wallaert is a white guy. A cowboy boot-wearing, born in the country, horse riding white guy. He is also a prominent male advocate and the scientist behind GetRaised, a free tool that has helped women earn over $2.3B in raises. In this session, Matt will talk about his continuing journey as a male advocate and how men in general can transform how they approach the issue of gender equity. Full of practical examples, the focus here is on the applied: this talk is about going beyond the moral imperative of equity to the daily living of an advocate.
