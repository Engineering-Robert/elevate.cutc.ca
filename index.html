                                Dave Wilkin is an “entrepreneur by mistake.” Unsure of what career path to take and faced with a tough job market, Wilkin began asking professionals from all kinds of different fields to meet him for coffee. Before he knew it, he had started his own business—Ten Thousand Coffees—a platform that build new relationships by matching people together to make them more successful, engaged, and connected. In a world where opportunity is driven by "who you know" and not "what you know", Ten Thousand Coffees makes access to the right people efficient, equal and convenient. Dave and his team are working with organizations, universities, regions and entrepreneurship networks to enable conversations, sharing and connections.
