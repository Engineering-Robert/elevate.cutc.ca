              Rick holds the role of Vice President leading the Emerging Technologies Team in the Canadian Banking Services organization.  He joined CGI after the acquisition of JSL in 2015 to lead the Emerging Technology division of CGI's banking and financial services division. Rick is responsible for Agile consulting services, banking technology products and services.
              As President and Co-owner of JSL, Rick oversaw a dynamic team of expert IT and Business/Technology Specialists who specialize in delivering technology related business solutions for their clients in the Financial Services Industry.
              <br><br>
              Rick is a dynamic business focused IT Executive who has spent close to 20 years leading large, transformational projects and teams for two of the World’s finest International Financial Institutions.  As the Canadian CIO for Macquarie Bank, Rick built an exceptional team of IT professionals responsible for all IT disciplines of Macquarie’s Canadian Retail & Commercial Lending divisions, Retail Brokerage and Global Investing Products divisions. Fortunately for CGI (and our customers), a core team of Rick’s best Macquarie employees followed Rick to JSL and then to CGI.
              <br><br>
              Rick has led the IT aspects of numerous acquisitions and divestitures, led significant big data, ERP, AML and Compliance Programs.

              <br><br>
              If you asked Rick which professional achievement he is most proud of, he would probably say; “What really puts a smile on my face is seeing people engaged and working together. The change in atmosphere is palatable, when you create the conditions for people to work effectively together, and actually enjoy the process, anything is possible and everything gets done with quality…”

              As the Director of Velocity, Jay advocates for entrepreneurship and provides guidance to startups to help them build successful businesses. Jay is passionate about enabling all contributors of the Kitchener-Waterloo startup ecosystem to punch above the region’s collective weight. Jay began his entrepreneurship journey ten years ago at the University of Waterloo, while pursuing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. During his studies, he co-founded BufferBox, which was ultimately acquired by Google, where Jay worked for 3.5 years before joining Velocity. What Jay finds most interesting about working in the startup world is the lack of a rule book, and the fact that early stage companies can do things in a way that larger companies can’t. When he is not mentoring companies, you can find Jay tinkering with hardware, playing squash, or teaching his parrot new tricks.

          <h3>What am I getting for my $$$?</h3>
          <p>
            We’ve been working hard to cut prices as much as possible to make sure cost doesn’t get in your way. You get access to keynotes, workshops, challenges, the Tech Expo, our pub night social, and a delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner!

          <h3>I can no longer attend CUTC, can I receive a refund?</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we do not provide refunds on tickets. However, we do allow you to transfer your ticket to someone else. Send us an <a href="mailto:robert.cooper@cutc.ca">email</a> if you would like to transfer your ticket.

          <h3>What’s the difference between CUTC and say, a hackathon?</h3>
          <p>
            At CUTC, it’s not just about hacking. Sure, you can get your hands dirty and create things during CGI’s Elevate Challenge or D+H's Tech Competition, but you also get to learn from the people in the trenches - entrepreneurs, pioneers in technology, and the guys who build and maintain the tech we use everyday.

          <h3>Can high school students attend the conference?</h3>

Successful applicants will be contacted shortly after on details about how to register. The cost for high school students is the same as for any other delegate (i.e. $35).
